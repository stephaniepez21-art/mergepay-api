/**
 * Public settlement status: the single source of truth a client can poll after
 * creating or signing a settlement.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The `settlements.status` column is an internal field that has accumulated
 * several values over time (`pending`, `submitted`, `confirmed`, `failed`,
 * `expired`, and whatever a future flow adds). Clients should not have to know
 * that set, nor infer progress from an unrelated group or expense response. This
 * module maps persisted state to a small, documented, stable set of public
 * values and combines it with an on-chain lookup.
 *
 * ## Public status values
 *
 *   awaiting_signature — the unsigned XDR has been issued; the wallet has not
 *                        returned a signed one yet. Client action: sign it.
 *   submitted          — a signed envelope has been accepted and is being
 *                        submitted; not yet visible or successful on-chain.
 *                        Client action: keep polling.
 *   confirmed          — the payment succeeded on-chain. Terminal.
 *   failed             — submission was rejected, or the transaction failed
 *                        on-chain. Terminal; `failure` explains why.
 *   expired            — the signing window closed before submission. Terminal;
 *                        the remedy is a new settlement, not a retry.
 *
 * ## "Not found on-chain" is not "confirmed"
 *
 * A transaction hash that Horizon does not yet know about is the *normal* state
 * for the first few seconds after submission — Horizon only sees a transaction
 * once it is in a closed ledger. Treating that as success would report a payment
 * that may still fail. So `onChain.found` is reported as `false` and the status
 * stays `submitted`; only an explicitly successful Horizon record advances it to
 * `confirmed`, and only an explicitly unsuccessful one to `failed`.
 *
 * ## What is never returned
 *
 * No signed or unsigned XDR, no anchor or session token, no provider
 * credentials, and no upstream error text or stack. Failure information is
 * limited to a short, already-scrubbed reason recorded by the worker.
