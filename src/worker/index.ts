/**
 * Background worker.
 *
 * Two job families run here — settlement submission and SEP-24 anchor
 * reconciliation — and both follow the same rules:
 *
 *  **Claim before work.** A job is claimed with a conditional update that also
 *  writes a lease (`claimedBy`, `leaseExpiresAt`). Only one worker can win that
 *  update, so two processes can never drive the same settlement transition. A
 *  worker that crashes leaves its lease behind; the lease lapses and the job
 *  becomes eligible again, which is what makes a restart resume work without
 *  duplicating it.
 *
 *  **Classify before retrying.** Every failure is categorised (see
 *  src/services/job-retry.ts). Transient failures get bounded, jittered
 *  exponential backoff. Indeterminate failures — a timeout, a dropped socket —
 *  are never blindly resubmitted: the envelope's hash is deterministic, so the
 *  worker asks Horizon whether the transaction already applied first. Permanent
 *  failures (rejected transaction, expired intent, authorization, validation)
 *  stop immediately and stay visible with a recorded reason.
 *
 *  **Persist the job state.** Attempts, the next eligible time, the failure
 *  category, and the final reason are all columns, not process memory, so the
 *  next cycle — or the next process — picks up exactly where this one stopped.
 *
 *  **Log operationally, never sensitively.** Every line carries a correlation
 *  id, job type, job id, attempt, and outcome. Signed XDRs, tokens, and secrets
 *  are scrubbed by `safeFailureMessage` and never logged or persisted.
 *
 * Settlement state transitions themselves stay authoritative in
 * src/services/settlement-machine.ts, which writes each change with its audit
 * record in one transaction.
